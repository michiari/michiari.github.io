I am a Computer Science PhD student in the [deepse]{:target="_blank"} group, at [DEIB]{:target="_blank"}, [Politecnico di Milano]{:target="_blank"}.
My supervisors are [Dino Mandrioli](https://mandrioli.faculty.polimi.it/){:target="_blank"} and [Matteo Pradella](https://pradella.faculty.polimi.it/){:target="_blank"}.  <br />
My research interests cover formal methods for the verification of safety-critical and real-time systems,
focusing on temporal logic, formal languages and automata theory.

I am currently working on context-free temporal logic and model checking.
In particular, I am developing new temporal logics based on Operator Precedence Languages,
with the purpose of allowing better and more general modelling and specification of procedural programs.

I am also interested in the verification of floating-point computations,
as well as approximate computing. <br />
I am part of the fabulous [TAFFO]{:target="_blank"} development team.
