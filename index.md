I am the PI of the [MSCA PF]{:target="_blank"} project [CORPORA]{:target="_blank"} hosted by the [TrustCPS]{:target="_blank"} group led by Univ-Prof Ezio Bartocci at [TU Wien]{:target="_blank"}.

My research interests cover formal methods for the verification of safety-critical and real-time systems,
focusing on temporal logic, formal languages and automata theory.

I am currently working on context-free temporal logic and (probabilistic) pushdown model checking.
In particular, I introduced a new temporal logic (POTL) based on Operator Precedence Languages,
with the purpose of allowing better and more general modelling and specification of recursive programs.
Within CORPORA, I am studying ways of verifying recursive probabilistic programs through probabilistic pushdown model checking.

I am also interested in the verification of floating-point computations,
as well as approximate computing.
I collaborated in the development of [TAFFO](https://taffo-org.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, a compiler-based precision-tuning framework.

Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate and then a PostDoc in the [deepse]{:target="_blank"} group, at [DEIB]{:target="_blank"}, [Politecnico di Milano]{:target="_blank"},
where I was involved in the [PIACERE H2020 project](https://www.piacere-project.eu/){:target="_blank"}, in which I was investigating ways of model checking Infrastructure-as-Code.
