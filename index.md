I am a Computer Science PhD student in the [deepse] group, at [DEIB], [Politecnico di Milano].
My supervisors are [Dino Mandrioli](http://home.deib.polimi.it/mandriol/SitoItaliano/sitowebpersit.html) and [Matteo Pradella](http://home.deib.polimi.it/pradella/).  <br />
My research interests cover formal methods for the verification of safety-critical and real-time systems,
focusing on temporal logic, formal languages and automata theory.

I am currently working on context-free temporal logic and model checking.
In particular, I am developing new temporal logics based on Operator Precedence Languages,
with the purpose of allowing better and more general modelling and specification of procedural programs.

I am also interested in the verification of floating-point computations,
as well as approximate computing. <br />
I am part of the fabulous [TAFFO] development team.
